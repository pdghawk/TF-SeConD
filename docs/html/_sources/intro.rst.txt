Introduction
==============

TF-SeConD (TensorFlow-SEmiCONductor Dynamics) is a python/tensorflow package
for the calculation of the interaction of ultrafast lasers with two-dimensional
crystals.

Calculating ultrafast dynamics, with the inclusion of the Coulomb interaction for
generic crystals, without making assumptions about their symmetry to reduce the
size of the problem is an expensive computational task. TF-SeConD is designed to
be able to handle generic band structures and dipole in a square lattice (could be
imported from DFT results from other software), without making such assumptions
so that it can be used for many crystal types easily. In order to handle the complexity
of the task, Tensorflow, which contains many functions useful for performing linear
algebra tasks on GPUs which are ideally suited to such tasks, is used.
