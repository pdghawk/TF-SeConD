to the documentation of the code base `here <https://pdghawk.github.io/TF-SeConD/html/TFSEC.html>`_.

TF-SeConD (TensorFlow-SEmiCONductor Dynamics) is a python/tensorflow package
for the calculation of the interaction of ultrafast lasers with two-dimensional
crystals.

Note: at this time I am not willing to make the code open source, however I am
making the documentation open source in order that potential employers can see
the types of problems and projects I have developed. If you have a genuine interest
in the underlying code for scientific purposes see below.

Disclaimer: this code has not been thoroughly tested to the levels required for
scientific publishing at this stage. It is intended as a personal project to
investigate the use of tensorflow for physics problems requiring many operations
with large, dense matrices. It is, however, almost at the point where significant
research could be performed.Please contact me if you are thinking of using this
software for any scientific research.
